# creating-deftly

**CreatingDeftly** is an open source project devoted to making automation of Adobe products easier with a unified API, chainable commands, and in-app gui tools.

#Caveats
This is still a new initiative and many applications are not yet supported.

# Mentions & Acknowledgements

Some of the APIs make use of json2.js - https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
