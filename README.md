# Creating Deftly


**Creating Deftly** is an open source project devoted to making automation of Adobe products easier with a unified API, chainable commands, and in-app gui tools.

If you're looking for an easier way to work with [Adobe's ExtendScript](https://creative.adobe.com/products/estk), .jsx, or .jsfl then consider using and contributing to CreatingDeftly.

### Caveats
This is still a new initiative and many applications are not yet supported.

[Here is the current roadmap](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1358100)

### Mentions & Acknowledgements

Some of the APIs make use of json2.js - https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
